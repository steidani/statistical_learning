# Tutorial in Statistical Learning
This repository contains tutorials and solutions for the Textbook ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani (2013).
This excellent book gives a good introduction to the field of **Statistical/Machine Learning**. 

**Python** is used to work through the book.
My main goal was to use this textbook to learn statistical learning / ML using Python.

Main Python (version 3.8.1) packages used:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- seaborn
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Lab for the notebooks

The data sets (csv files) from the book can be downloaded from [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/).
